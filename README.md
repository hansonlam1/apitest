# apitest
The purpose of this project is to start playing around with the native IB Python API.

##main.py
Many thanks to the GitHub gist at vpribish/IBAPIpythonexample1.py
as well as  robcarver17/IBAPIpythonexample1.py

The code here is basically the same as those examples

I did not fork that repo as I wanted to manually go through and
recreate it to maximize my familiarity with ibapi

I will add additional stuff as I explore functions and features

##reqHistoricalData.py 
Trying a very basic request for historical data.
Keeping it to the bare basics for making a call to get information from IB
